Volume The Unseen

Book Kinds of Things

Part indicator light

An indicator light is a kind of thing. An indicator light has some text called
colour. The colour of an indicator light is usually "red".

Part codelock

Chapter declaration

A codelock is a kind of thing.

A codelock has some text called the password. The password is usually "admin".

A codelock has a door called the controllable. [TODO - make this a list of
doors, for a codelock should be able to simultaneously unlock several doors
connected to it]

Chapter implementation

Inputting a password into something is an action applying to one thing and one topic.
Check inputting a password into something: do nothing.
Carry out Inputting a password into something:
    if the noun is a codelock begin;
        say "You input the password '[topic understood]'.";
        let input be ""; now input is the topic understood;
        if input is the password of the noun begin;
            now the controllable of the noun is unlocked;
            say "Correct! - the [the controllable of the noun] unlocks.";
        [even if a codelock was unlocked, it will lock if the wrong password is entered]
        otherwise if the controllable of the noun is unlocked and the
        controllable of the noun is closed;
            say "Wrong password - the previously unlocked [controllable of the noun] now locks.";
            now the controllable of the noun is locked;
        otherwise;
            say "Seems to be the wrong password.";
        end if; 
    end if;
Report inputting a password into something: do nothing.
Understand "Input [text] into [codelock]" as Inputting a password into something (with nouns reversed).
[try to implement "input code <text> into, dial <text>, type <text> into, etc" as well]

Part book

    A linkbook has some text called transition_text.

Chapter implementation

instead of touching a linkbook:
    say transition_text of the noun;
    say "[paragraph break]";
    now the player is in the linked_room of the noun.

Book General Activities

Part Reading

Understand the command "read" as something new.
Reading is an action applying to one thing, requiring light.

Volume The Seen


Book The Void

The Wanderers Journal Part III is a book.
The printing of the Wanderers Journal Part III is "One glimpses happiness in
its fullness only when one gazes deep beyond oneself, into the lives of others,
into the world and into the decades, centuries and millennia that extend far
past ones own lifetime. A letter carried in the hearts of those who one touches
and the effects of ones every action reverberating down the strings of time
through the ages to come. Humankind will quickly forget, but the world will
always remember. This legacy, will it be kindness bringing warmth, hope and
reason, or an ever-hungry shadow that eats the final light of a dying day? The
less temporal the foundation of a goal is, the longer and fuller is the
happiness brought about by progress. Nothing can last longer that the power
that created time, as that which existed before time is not bound by it.  Thus
a goal that transcends time is a goal that brings complete fulfilment -
ultimate self-realization as can be understood by beings bound by time."

The Wanderers Journal Part IV is a book.
The printing of the Wanderers Journal Part IV is "Truly fascinating is the
miracle of life. In the vast expanse of the universe, there are but a few motes
which are able to experience, to observe the universe around them and to
experience their 'self'. Happiness and joy as well as sadness, fear, anguish,
terror, loss, and wonder, awe and so many other feelings as part of our unique
adventure. Pleasant or not at any given moment, this rare occurrence in the
vastness of the universe is a precious gift. The gift to be able to experience
said moment and form memories, to contemplate existence itself. Cherish it, as
it lasts but a tiny moment in the vast ocean of time and space."

The Wanderers Journal Part V is a book.
The printing of the Wanderers Journal Part V is "Sometimes we are blinded by
our own state of mind to the wonders of life around us. Remember the precious
things of today, write them down even, so when it seems there is nothing
pleasant or good any more - you can read and realise that you at that moment
are merely blinded by the fickle mind to the beauty of the universe. And that
is also beautiful and strange."

The Shadow Terminus is a room. "The place where trains depart into the worlds
of thought."
The benevolent shadow is a person in the Shadow Terminus. "You feel the

you and you have followed that enigmatic figure that disappeared right around a
dark corner, dropping a strange book in its wake. I did not intend for you to
follow me, but I assumed you might, so I left this note for you to help you --
at leas a little bit -- to navigate the quite surreal place you have gotten
yourself into. You have followed in the footsteps of a creator of worlds, and
you have stepped into a realm where time flows differently than you are used to
and many rules of reality apply differently or not at all. I believe you will
be quite fine, but I must warn you to be cautious, because there are some more
dangerous places in this realm. I shall try to guide you away from harm, but I
take no responsibility for your actions. As you are soon to realise this is all
a work in progress, perfect in it's unfinished state, some places are more
chaotic - always evolving and changing, while others are still and serene.
Even though you are trespassing, I mean you no harm and hope for your safe
return home if you shall so wish. Maybe, though, after seeing the wonders of
this realm, you shall wish to pick up the art. Somewhere around here should be
another of those strange books, it should be green and titled 'Jnanin', it is
what is called a linking book, you can travel to another world by touching it's
front page with your palm and wishing yourself in. Hopefully our paths will
cross again. Good luck and have a safe journey."

planet -- it is patterned with luminous circles and lines of pale green light,
some of the circles are concentric - mostly around a large cenetral area in the
pattern which might be a giant city, some are unfinished, there are also some
dots and streaks of yellow and orange. Part of the planet above meets the

circles and lines of pale green light, some of the circles are concentric -
especially around what seems to be a cenetral area in the pattern - and some
are unfinished, there are also some dots and streaks of yellowish coloration.
Throughout the glowing pattern the intencity of illumination varies as if the
entire thing is made of thousands of tiny lights, it may be a giant, greenish,
concentric, city if the sphere is a planet. The sphere is surrounded by stars,
it does look like a planet."
The bookshelf is a container in Cabin E. It is fixed in place.

    system. It has two, quite remarkable moons known as the 'Island' and the 'Rock'
    respectively. The main city of Thaulurnon has vastly expanded since the
    colonisation of the world and has long since been known as The City of
    Thaulurnon. Its main imperial spaceport has the imperial intrastellar
    registration number A04A00A01, second only to the Royal Military Spaceport of
    Thaulurnon, which has the honorable notation ending in a triple zero."

    A blue book is a book inside the bookshelf.
    The description is "Golden text on the blue cover of the book reads 'The
    Unified Intrastellar Transportation System: A Traveller's Guide'."
    The printing of the blue book is "As the Empire grew among the stars all
    it's worlds had quite differend internal transportation systems and with the
    development and eventual ubiquity of interplanetary and interstellar
    transportation it became increasingly difficult for the interstellar citizen to
    adapt to the vast variety of in-system means of transportation. Thus all
    systems at and above the development index of C have to standartize the
    interstellar transportation sceme of the realm in accordance to the imperial
    minimal standards of interstellar passenger transportation. In time the
    coordinate systems have also been unified minimising the array of differences
    for the interstellar imperial traveler to adapt to. The coordinate system that
    was chosen is the now long standard 'triplet of threes' intrastellar
    destination address system forming a single number of three parts, the first
    three digits stand for the destination body's distance from the sun, the second
    triplet stands for the number of the moon - three zeros if the destination is
    the main body - and the last triplet stands for the local number of the
    imperial spaceport. For example the intrastellar address of the Main Imperial
    Spaceport of Planet Thaulurnon is A04A00A01, the adress of the main port on the
    'Island' which is the first moon of Thaulurnon is respectively A04A01A01."
